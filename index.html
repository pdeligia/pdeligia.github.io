        <p>
          I am a Principal Research Software Engineer at
          <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/" target="blank">Microsoft Research</a>.</br>
          I enjoy working at the intersection of AI, programming languages and software reliability.
          More specifically, I am R&D'ing new tools and techniques for helping developers
          be more productive and build more reliable systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          At Microsoft, I created <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/coyote/" target="blank">Coyote</a>,
          an award-winning tool for intelligently testing concurrent C# code and deterministically reproducing bugs.
          Coyote is used by many core engineering teams across Azure, where it has found tons of critical bugs before
          they hit production and impact end-users.
          Besides Coyote, I have worked on several other R&D projects during the past 7 years at Microsoft Research,
          mostly focused on tackling PL and systems related problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got my PhD in Computing at
          <a href="http://www3.imperial.ac.uk" target="blank">Imperial College London</a>,
          where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor
          <a href="http://multicore.doc.ic.ac.uk/" target="blank">Alastair F. Donaldson</a>.
        </p>

        <p>I am currently working on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>AI for Software Reliability</b>:
            I am exploring new approaches in harnessing the power of AI (and LLMs) to improve the
            reliability of software and dramatically improve developer productivity.

            <b>Coyote</b>,
            a tool for intelligently testing concurrent C# code and deterministically reproducing
            bugs. It is used across many core teams in Azure (including Compute, Storage and Networking),
            as well as Microsoft Teams, and has discovered hundreds of critical bugs before they hit production.

            <b>Coyote Actors</b>,
            a library and runtime for building reliable distributed systems using the actor programming model.
            It is the production runtime for several core services in Azure Compute.
            The library interoperates with the Coyote test engine, allowing developers to test their distributed
            systems, and find and reproduce bugs before deploying to production.

            developing and testing asynchronous software using asynchronous communicating state-machines.
            P# started as my internship project at Microsoft Research and then became the main topic of my PhD thesis.
            P# was used in production as the runtime that powers several core Azure Batch microservices,
            and has since evolved into
